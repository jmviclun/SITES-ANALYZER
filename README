This program reads 3D atomic positions of molecules (e.g. .pdb file) and analyzes the population inside defined input sites.
In addition, It makes average ocupation profiles in 1 and 2 dimensions.
The program gives the possibility of create a pdb file with the surface of defined sites. 
The program works with the positions in cartesians coordinates (x,y,z,90,90,90), modifying the fractional units (a,b,c,alpha,beta,gamma) (If needed) attending to:
1) The a cell vector is aligned along the x-axis
2) The b cell vector is aligned in the xy-plane 

Some examples resulting from adsorption of gasses in porous materials are in the examples folder

To run the program, copy the zzrunSITES script and sites.input file to your working directory.
If ComputeSites is set as "yes" XXXX_Framework_sites.pdb file should be in the working directory (where XXXX is the FrameworkName requested in the sites.input).
The run the program:

> ./zzrunSITES your_file.pdb

or save the zzrunSITES in ~/bin folder and type: (RECOMMENDED)

> zzrunSITES your_file.pdb

where your_file.pdb is the file that contain the 3-dimensional positions of the atoms.
By default the program read a standard file in .pdb format https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_Data_Bank_(file_format) with structure:
